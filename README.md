The objective of this project is to analyze sales performance using the Superstore dataset and build an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides executive-level insights into revenue growth, profitability, product performance, and regional contribution.

## Dataset


## Questions (KPIs)

- What is the overall profit margin (%)?
- How many total orders were placed, and what is the average order value?
- How are sales and profit trending over time?
- Is the business growing year-over-year?
- Which categories and products drive the highest revenue?
- Which products are consistently loss-making?
- Are high-selling products equally profitable?
- Which region contributes the most to total sales?
- Which region generates the highest profit?
- Which customer segment contributes the most to overall profit margin?
- Are there customers generating high sales but low profitability?
- How does discount percentage impact profit margin?
- Do higher discounts reduce overall profitability?
- Where are the biggest opportunities to improve margins?



## Process
Raw Superstore dataset (Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity, Category, Region, Segment)

↓ Data cleaning & validation (Power BI / Power Query)

↓ Data modeling & relationship setup

↓ DAX measure creation
  • Total Sales
  • Total Profit
  • Profit Margin (%)
  • Average Order Value
  • Total Orders
  • YoY Growth

↓ 3-page interactive dashboard design:

  • Page 1: Executive Overview (KPIs + Trends + Quarterly Comparison)
  • Page 2: Category & Product Performance (Top & Bottom Analysis)
  • Page 3: Region & Customer Insights (Regional Contribution + Segment Profitability + Customer Margin Analysis)

↓ Business insight generation & strategic recommendations

↓ Final dashboard formatting (visual hierarchy + consistent color theme)

↓ GitHub portfolio repository documentation

## Dashboard 
### Executive Overview : 
- Provides a high-level summary of overall sales performance, profitability, and growth trends to help leadership quickly assess business health.




### Category & Product Performance : 
- Analyzes category-wise sales and profit while identifying top-performing and loss-making products to support product and pricing decisions.




### Region & Customer Insights :

## Project Insights : 
🏆 **Central region dominates revenue – 36.9% of total sales and ₹311K in profit**

💰 **Consumer segment leads profitability** – Contributes 50.6% of overall profit margin

📊 **Technology is the strongest category** – Highest sales and profit contribution

⚠️ **Furniture** shows lower margin efficiency – **High sales but weaker profitability**

📉 High discounts reduce profit margin – Clear negative correlation observed

🎯 Customer-level margin variation exists – Opportunity for targeted pricing optimization
